# Jedi
New interpreted language created using Scala. The language is made up of an interpreter, which is completely written in Scala. This language has many of the common
features of a modern programming language, including functional calls, iteration, lambda expressions, and closures. The language even features both dynamic/static scoping of 
variables, which can be changed from one to the other depending on the user's preference.
